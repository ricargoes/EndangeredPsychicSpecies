# EPS - Endangered Psychic Species
Escape from the city with the last specimen available of an endangered alien species. But the alien is cunning. And a psychic! And he likes to throw stuff at you to break free and bite electric cables (they are sparky!). Keep it alive.

This is a 2 player game. One player plays with the keyboard and the other with the mouse.

Enjoy! :)

Game made for the Ludum Dare 46
